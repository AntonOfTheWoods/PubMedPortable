PubMed2Go
=========

PubMed2Go automatically builds a PostgreSQL relational database schema and a Xapian full text index on PubMed XML files as well as it provides an interface to BioC.

Please, have a look at "documentation/wiki.rst" or the Wiki page in GitHub for installation instructions, setting up a database, and querying it. There is also a short installation guide in "documentation/quick_install.rst". The RST files exist as HTML files as well.
